# Common confounders and artefacts

* History effects refer to the possibility that specific events may occur during the study that might influence the outcome measure. A specific type of history effect is the repeated testing effect where a previous measurement might effect the results of a current measurement. 
* Maturation effects are similar however it doesn't refer to specific events like history effects, rather they relate to how people change on their own over time.
* Selection bias is the bias introduced by the selection of individuals, groups, or data for analysis in such a way that proper randomization is not achieved, thereby failing to ensure that the sample obtained is representative of the population intended to be analyzed (taken straight from wikipedia lol)
* Regression to the mean refers to any situation where you select data based on an extreme value on some measure. Because the variable has natural variation it almost certainly means that when you take a subsequent measurement the later measurement will be less extreme than the first one, purely by chance.
* Experimenter bias can come in multiple forms. The basic idea is that the experimenter, despite the best of intentions, can accidentally end up influencing the results of the experiment by subtly communicating the “right answer” or the “desired behaviour” to the participants. The solution is generally double blind studies though these aren't perfect.
* What is generally referred to as reactivity or demand effects is the idea that it’s almost impossible to stop people from knowing that they’re part of a psychological study. And the mere fact of knowing that someone is watching or studying you can have a pretty big effect on behaviour.

**NOTE:** This isn't comprehensive, I fail to mention things like Differential Attrition and non-response bias.
