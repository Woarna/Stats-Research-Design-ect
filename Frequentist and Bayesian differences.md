# Frequentist view

The frequentist defines probability as a long-run frequency. 
The probability of an event is it's relative frequency in some amount of trials N, where the limit of N is taken to infinity. 

* The frequentist view has a desirable characteristic. it's objective. The pobability of an event is necessarily grounded.
If two people observed the same sequence of trials they would arrive at the same probability.
* The frequentist view also has undesirable characteristics. First, infinite sequences don't actually exist so it might be hard to say that it's a meaningful concept.
Secondly, there are things that we do assign probabilities too that can't be mapped onto a sequence of events. A frequentist view of probability generally doesn't allow probability
statements for single events. It's important to note however that frequentists have come up with methods to get around this.

# Bayesian view

The bayesian (also called subjectivist) view is varied but usually the most common way of defining probability of an event to a Bayesian is as the degree of belief that a
rational agent assigns to the truth of the event. 

* The advantages of the Bayesian view are that we can assign probabilites to any event we want, we're not just limited to events that can be repeated
* The downsides of the Bayesian view is that it isn't as objective as the frequentist approach. It is important to note however that the Bayesian approach requires agents to be
rational (i,e obey the laws of probability) it still does allow two different rational observers to attribute different probabilities to the same event.

# Which view is correct?

Neither views are mathematically incorrect and in fact it's actually the case that a lot of frequentist methods lead to decisions Bayesians agree a rational agent would make and 
many Bayesian methods have good frequentist properties. It's important to note the majority of statistical analysis in academia is based on Frequentist approaches however so
any Bayesian should have a good understanding of frequentist methods.
