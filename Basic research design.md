# How to know how good a measure is

When determining if a measure is good we look at validity and reliability. 
The reliability of a measure tells you how precisely you are measuring something while the validity of a measure tells you how accurate the measure is.

# Reliability

Reliability will refer the repeatability or consistency of your measurement. 
For example a bathroom scale will be "reliable" because the measurement of my weight will be consistent the multiple times I weigh myself. 
It's important to note that reliability is different from whether or not the measure is correct. 
It's possible for the measurement to be wrong, but if I keep consistently getting the same measure it's reliable

A measure that is reliable but doesn't give the correct measure is "reliable but invalid" likewise it's plausible for a measure to be "valid but unreliable". 
Though it is hard to determine whether a measure is valid if it is not reliable and as such some researches will say that reliability is a necessary condition for validity, 
and for practical concerns a measure that is unreliable will not be valid. 

The different ways in which we measure reliability are the following:

**NOTE:** Not all measurements need to posses all forms of reliability

# Validity

There isn't a precise clearly agreed upon notion of what validity is, I'll give a few different notions of validity here. 
Internal validity, External validity, Construct validity, Face validity, and ecological validity. 
Out of these notions, the most important are internal and external validity though the rest do hold some importance. 

* Internal validity refers to the extent to which you are able draw the correct conclusions about the causal relationships between variables. Failure to draw correct causal relationships between variables may indicate a lack of internal validity.
* External validity relates to the generalizability or applicability of your findings. That is, to what extent do you expect to see the same pattern of results in “real life” as you saw in the study. If the results of the study don't apply to people and situations beyond the ones in the study there is a lack of external validity. The external validity of a study is threatened by the choice of population. If the population from which you sample your participants is very narrow and if the narrow population that you sampled from is systematically different from the general population in some respect that is relevant to the psychological phenomenon that you intend to study. 
* Construct validity relates to whether or not what your measuring is what you intend to measure. A measurement has good construct validity if it is actually measuring the correct theoretical construct, and bad construct validity if it doesn’t.
* Face validity relates to whether or not a measure looks like its doing what its meant to be doing. Not very important but sadly serves the pragmatic usages of being convincing to idiots.
* Ecological validity relates to whether the setup of a study closely approximates the real world scenario that is being investigated. The intuition is that a study that is ecologically valid is more likely to be externally valid. This of course isn't always true.

The two biggest worries we have towards validity is confounders and artefacts.

**NOTE:** If a confounder has been measured you can use statistical methods to deal with it. When measured and dealt with they're referred to as covariate.

# Experimental vs Non-experimental research

In experimental research the researcher will manipulate the independent variables but will allow the dependent variables to vary naturally. 
The idea here is to manipulate the IV to see if they have any causal effects on outcomes. I
n order to ensure no other variables are effecting the DV all other variables are kept constant. 
Since this is impossible in practice a researcher will use randomization. 
Researchers will randomly assign people to different groups, and then give each group a different treatment (i.e., assign them different values of the predictor variables). 
This process minimizes (NOT eliminates) the possibility of systematic differences between groups.

Non-experimental research is the opposite, the researcher does not have nearly as much control as they do in experimental research. 
This type of research can be divided into quasi-experimental research and case studies. 
Quasi-experimental research is the same as experiments except researches DONT control for IV's. 
Case studies are detailed descriptions of unique events with very few instances.

**NOTE:** It's usually hard to draw general conclusions about people in general from very few instances.
