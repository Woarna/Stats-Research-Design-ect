# Quantitative vs Qualitative split

Quantitative data is data in terms of values or numbers, Qualitative data is observed qualities of what is being measured usually things that aren't numbered and are named. 
Quantitative Data can be further split into two types of data, Discrete and Continuous.

# Scales of measurement

Another distinction between types of Data is what scale the data is on. Whether it's Nominal, Ordinal, Interval, or Ratio. Qualitative data is subdivided 
into Nominal and Ordinal data while Quantitative data is subdivided into Interval or Ratio data. 

* Nominal scale data is data that's been named but there exists no real order between the data. An example is eye color, eye's can be blue, green, brown, ect but there isn't any real way to order them. It's not like blue is "bigger" than green.
* Ordinal scale data is data that has been named like Nominal scale data, the key difference however is that it can be meaningfully ordered. An example can be position in a race, we know that the 1st placed ahead of 2nd, and 2nd placed ahead of third. It's important to note that while we can say that the person who placed 1st finished faster then 2nd we don't know how much they're faster from this type of data. We also can't say the difference between 1st and 2nd is equal to the distance between the 2nd and third
* Interval scale data is data that has a meaningful numerical value attached while also having differences between values that are meaningful. Interval variables however do not have a "natural" zero value that means lack of some thing. An example of Interval scale data is temperature measurements in Celsius. If it was 15 degrees today, and 17 degrees tomorrow, the 2 degree difference is meaningful. moreover this 2 degree difference is the same between 13 and 15 degrees. (This is technically not true since temperature isn’t strictly an interval scale, in the sense that the amount of energy required to heat something up by 2 degrees depends on it’s current temperature but ignoring this gives us a neat example). Notice that 0 degrees doesn't mean lack of temperature however. as a result it doesn't make sense to do multiplication or division, 20 degrees isn't "Twice" as hot as 10 degrees.
* Ratio scale data is data in which the 0 really means the lack of something. Multiplication and division are meaningful with this type of data. An example of ratio scale data would be Kelvin or Time Intervals

**NOTE:** not all data falls into these categories neatly, these should be treated as guidelines not strict categories.
